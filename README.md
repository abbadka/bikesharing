# Bike Sharing Prediction

This project is an exercise in deep learning as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree program from Udacity. In this notebook, we develop a neural network that would predict the rentals for bikes based on given data. The base for the project is obtained from: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch

## Getting Started

In order to run this project, it is recommended to use an Anaconda environment. Create the anaconda environment using the following command:

```
conda create --name dlnd python=3
```

To use the environment, execute the following:

#### For mac / linux:

```
source activate dlnd
```

#### For windows:

```
activate dlnd
```

Afterwards, install the requirements as follows:

```
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```

### Notes

This is a very basic neural network that aims to introduce the concepts. To learn more about this and to learn how to use existing libraries for training neural networks, I would recommend looking at the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.
